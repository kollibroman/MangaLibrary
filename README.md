## MangaLibrary

I still don't know if this will be just for storing mangas or to read them as well, but yeah some API project with some basic frontend

### Contributions

Do as you like, I'm scared of good frontend :3

### State of project

Basic backend is made, now I'm doing the frontend

### Is it usable? Ofc, just do the following
    1. Install dotnet sdk and shit (on linux, just install everything from dotnet in ur pkg manager)
    2. Run `dotnet tool install -g Microsoft.Tye --version "0.11.0-alpha.22111.1"`
    3. In project dir run `tye run` command
    4. Open site given in logs (50% chance to pick good one)

### Uhh... YES.
